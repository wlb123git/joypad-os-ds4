# Wiring Guide

How to wire USB host ports and console connectors to your board.

## USB Host Port Wiring

Most RP2040 boards need a USB-A connector wired to specific GPIO pins for controller input.

> **Note:** The Adafruit Feather RP2040 USB Host has a built-in USB-A port — no wiring needed. nRF52840 boards use MAX3421E for USB host instead of PIO-USB.

### How It Works

Joypad uses PIO-based USB host (bit-banged via the RP2040's PIO peripheral). This allows **simultaneous USB host and device** — the native USB port acts as device (for flashing and USB output modes) while PIO USB provides the host port for controllers.

- Full Speed (12 Mbps) only
- D+ and D- must be on consecutive GPIOs (D- = D+ + 1)
- **Single device only** — USB hubs are not supported on PIO USB host due to [upstream issues](https://github.com/sekigon-gonnoc/Pico-PIO-USB/issues/149) with enumeration and disconnect detection

### Pin Reference

| Board | D+ | D- | VBUS | Notes |
|-------|----|----|------|-------|
| Raspberry Pi Pico | GPIO 16 | GPIO 17 | VBUS (pin 40) | |
| Raspberry Pi Pico W | GPIO 16 | GPIO 17 | VBUS (pin 40) | |
| Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W | GPIO 16 | GPIO 17 | VBUS (pin 40) | |
| Adafruit Feather RP2040 USB Host | GPIO 16 | GPIO 17 | GPIO 18 | Built-in USB-A port, no wiring needed |
| Waveshare RP2040-Zero | GPIO 10 | GPIO 11 | 5V | Compact boards |
| Waveshare RP2350A USB-A | GPIO 12 | GPIO 13 | 5V | Has built-in USB-A port |

### USB-A Connector Pinout

```
  ┌───────────────────┐

```

| USB-A Pin | Signal | Color (typical) |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | VBUS (+5V) | Red |
| 2 | D- | White |
| 3 | D+ | Green |
| 4 | GND | Black |

### Raspberry Pi Pico / Pico W / Pico 2 W

| Pico Pin | USB-A Pin | Signal |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| GPIO 16 (pin 21) | 3 | D+ (green) |
| GPIO 17 (pin 22) | 2 | D- (white) |
| VBUS (pin 40) | 1 | 5V (red) |
| GND (pin 38) | 4 | GND (black) |

> **Power note:** VBUS on pin 40 passes through 5V from the Pico's own USB connection. If your controller needs more power (e.g. rumble), power the Pico via VSYS with a 5V supply and connect that supply to USB-A pin 1 instead.

### Waveshare RP2040-Zero

| RP2040-Zero Pin | USB-A Pin | Signal |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| GPIO 10 | 3 | D+ (green) |
| GPIO 11 | 2 | D- (white) |
| 5V | 1 | 5V (red) |
| GND | 4 | GND (black) |

### What You Need

- **USB-A female breakout board** ([example](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1833)) or a cut USB-A extension cable
- **4 jumper wires** (or 22-26 AWG wire + soldering)

### Tips

- **Double-check D+ and D-** — swapping them is the most common mistake and will silently fail
- **Keep wires short** — USB signal integrity degrades with long runs; under 15cm is ideal
- **USB-A breakout boards** are easier than cutting cables — labeled pins reduce wiring errors
- **No hubs** — connect your controller directly to the USB-A port (hubs are not reliable on PIO USB)

### Troubleshooting

**No controller detected:**
- Verify D+ and D- are not swapped
- Check that VBUS is providing 5V to the USB-A connector
- Try a different controller or cable
- Confirm you flashed the correct firmware for your board

**Controller disconnects or is flaky:**
- Shorten your wires
- Check for cold solder joints
- Some controllers draw more current than VBUS can supply — use external 5V power

**Works with some controllers but not others:**
- Check the [controller compatibility list](controllers.md) for supported devices
