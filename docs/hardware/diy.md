# DIY Builds

Everything you need to build your own Joypad adapter.

## General Requirements

1. **Microcontroller board** (see [Supported Boards](boards.md))
2. **USB cable** (USB-C or Micro-USB, depending on board)
3. **Console connector** (specific to target console)
4. **Wires** (22-26 AWG)
5. **Soldering iron** and solder
6. **Optional**: Level shifters, resistors, capacitors

## USB Host Port

Most boards need a USB-A connector wired to GPIO pins for controller input. See the [Wiring Guide](wiring.md) for complete pin assignments and diagrams.

**Exception**: The Adafruit Feather RP2040 USB Host has a built-in USB-A port — no wiring needed.

## Console-Specific Pinouts

Each adapter has its own wiring diagram in its documentation:

- [PCEngine Pinout](../adapters/pcengine.md#pin-configuration)
- [GameCube Pinout](../adapters/gamecube.md#hardware-requirements)
- [Dreamcast Pinout](../adapters/dreamcast.md#dreamcast-controller-connector-pinout)
- [Nuon Pinout](../adapters/nuon.md#hardware-requirements)
- [3DO Pinout](../adapters/3do.md#wiring-diagram)
- [Neo Geo Pinout](../adapters/neogeo.md#hardware-requirements)

## Common Mistakes

- Reversed power polarity
- Wrong voltage (5V vs 3.3V)
- Cold solder joints
- Crossed data lines (especially D+ and D- on USB host)
- Missing pullup resistors
- Incorrect GPIO pin assignments
- Using a charge-only USB cable (no data lines)
